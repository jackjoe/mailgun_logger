## 2305.1.0 (2023-05-02)

**BREAKING**

In this release, we are no longer saving the actual stored message (the raw data) as it has proven to be too much stress on the db without any added value. There is a config option `store_message` that, if set to `true` also requires an AWS config to be added. Then the raw messages will be stored in an S3 bucket.
Also, the `stored_message` data column should be regarded as deprecated and will be removed via a migration in a future release.

- Add AWS config and option to store the raw message there.

**POSSIBLY BREAKING! (Possibly, but not surely, so no 1.0.0 yet!)**

We had to alter the unique index (stupid mistake... more tests, anyone ;) ?). We do have a migration but it could be possible you have to alter that index yourself. It should be fairly easy, just add a unique constraint on the `accounts` table for columsn `api_key` and `domain`.

- fixed unique constraint for API key and domain on accounts. ([#7][i7])
